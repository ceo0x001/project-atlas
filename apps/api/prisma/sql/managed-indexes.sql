--
-- Prisma cannot express these index types, so they live here rather than in
-- schema.prisma. The consequence is that Prisma sees them as schema drift and emits
-- `DROP INDEX` for them in *every* migration it generates. That is not a one-off
-- annoyance — it is a standing trap: forget once and semantic recall silently falls
-- back to a sequential scan over every episode, or transaction search does.
--
-- Two defences, deliberately overlapping:
--
--   1. Delete the `DROP INDEX` lines from the generated migration.
--   2. Append this file to it anyway. Every statement is `IF NOT EXISTS`, so it is
--      safe to run repeatedly and it self-heals if step 1 was missed — the index is
--      simply rebuilt inside the same transaction.
--
-- `test/schema-indexes.integration.test.ts` asserts both indexes exist, so a
-- migration that loses them fails CI rather than quietly degrading production.

-- Episodic memory recall. Cosine distance matches the embedding model's similarity
-- metric; the dimension must stay in step with EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS and the
-- vector(1024) column.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS episodes_embedding_hnsw
